# Ponte las Pilas Frontend 

## Author: Monica Ramirez

This project will be a "motivational" quote generator. Growing up, my mom would have these sayings in Spanish that sometimes sounded so profound and deep... and other times not so much. This idea was born out of all of those memories growing up, it was inspired by my mom. The quotes generated will be Mexican proverbs and sayings.
